/**
 * This class will be restructured to perform the final step, step 23. This class must perform the

 *
 * 1.) Allow user: a.) Add a new product b.) Specify how many items of that product should be
 * created.
 *
 * 2.) Program will then: a.) Create these items b.) Store them in a collection.
 *
 * 3.) New products can be added at any time a.) Menu option
 *
 * 4.) Production statistics can be displayed a.) Menu option b.) Total items produced c.) Number of
 * each item d.) Number of unique products created
 *
 * 5.) Operator will decide when to stop the program a.) Menu option
 *
 * 6.) Program will be menu driven. Can be either: a.) Console program, or b.) Richer graphical user
