The Product class contains five private variables:
  1.) serialNumber - this may need to be a static variable since no item should have the same
      serial number. It receives a value from a constructor.

  2.) manufacturer - a String containing the name of the manufacturer

  3.) manufacturedOn - a Date object, which should store the time an item was manufactured on,
      but has not yet received code stating as such.

  4.) name - a String object containing the name of the item being produced.

  5.) currentProductionNumber - an int value which a constructor uses to assign to a serial number
